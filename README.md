Hi I have Created a simpla 100 line/1 activity code for detecting if a device is connected to internet or not
This App can check if the device has internet connectivity with this app<br>
This code can tell you if you are connected then which type of network is the phone using 
<ol>
<li>Wifi</li> 
<li>Mobile Data</li>
</ol>
